Tracksuits and red wine, movies for two
We’ll take off our phones and we’ll turn off our shoes
We’ll play Nintendo though I always lose
Cos you watch the TV while I’m watching you...
There's not many people I'd honestly say I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
Dumb conversation, we lose track of time
Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine
We watch The Notebook for the 17th time
I'll say it's stupid, then you catch me crying
